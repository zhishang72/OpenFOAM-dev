dnsFoam has been superseded and replaced by the more general
incompressibleFluid solver module with the OUForce fvModel
executed by the foamRun application:

    foamRun -solver incompressibleFluid

The random OU process force is applied using the OUForce fvModel specified in the
constant/fvModels dictionary, e.g.:

OUForce
{
    type    OUForce;

    libs    ("librandomProcesses.so");

    sigma   0.090295;
    alpha   0.81532;
    kUpper  10;
    kLower  7;
}
