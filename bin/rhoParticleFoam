#     The isothermalFluid solver specified by either the subSolver or if not
#     present the solver entry in the controlDict is instantiated to provide the

#     fvModel is selected to evolve the Lagrangian particles.

rhoParticleFoam has been superseded and replaced by the more general functions
solver module executed by the foamRun application:

    foamRun -solver functions

The isothermalFluid solver specified by either the subSolver or if not present
the solver entry in the controlDict is instantiated to provide the physical
fields needed by fvModel functionObject in which the clouds fvModel is selected
to evolve the Lagrangian particles.
