# Script
#     reconstructParMesh
#
# Description
#     Script to inform the user that reconstructParMesh has been superseded
#     and replaced by the more general reconstructPar utility.
#

cat <<EOF

The reconstructParMesh utility has been superseded and replaced by the more
general reconstructPar.

The reconstructPar utility now reconstructs the mesh if and when it is
necessary; i.e., when it has changed in the processor* directories as a result
of utility usage or dynamic mesh changes.

Most parallel workflows previously included a call to reconstructParMesh first
to reconstruct the mesh, and then called reconstructPar for the fields. This
sort of workflow can be updated by removing the call to reconstructParMesh.
